    "The paper describes a method for creating abstracted geometry based on an initial pre-segmented input model. This is transformed into an abstracted version by applying Gestalt principles on objects according to sketches by the user. Groupings of the scene elements according to these rules are computed and abstractions are created summarizing the objects into bounding volumes or replacing geometries with scaled versions, depending on the intent of the user abstraction\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook I implement a demonstration of the core principles of using gestalt rules to guiding the abstraction of a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we load / generate a simple scene with primitives in it ordered and aligned in a way so that different patterns and Gestalt shapes emerge naturally to the viewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this the program implements metrics from the paper to programmatically figure out these structures and mark the objects accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program then visualizes this intial guess and lets the user show his intent of which of the objects to abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now using the intent and the previous knowledge a simple abstraction is computed and also rendered in the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive loop now should already provide a basic understanding of how the method from the paper works albeit being very simple in its design.\n"
